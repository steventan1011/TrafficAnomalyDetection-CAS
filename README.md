# TrafficAnomalyDetection-a-CAS-project-
This is a project about Traffic Anomaly Detection (a CAS project)

**[Python, NMF, clustering analysis, PCA, scoring function]**

Project: developing a system to detect real-time non-recurrent traffic anomalies throughout Beijing 

1. Mined data from 9 daysâ€™ GPS database of 20,000 taxis to obtain information about the traffic flow 

2. Performed NMF (non-negative matrix factorization) to disperse the traffic peak and conducted methods like K-means clustering analysis, GPS link matching, PCA (principal component analysis) in data cleaning  

3. Designed the abnormal scoring function algorithm based on historical/ neighbor scoring function to generate the score coefficient matrix and used real-time data anomaly detection to evaluate the sections 

4. Established the urban traffic anomaly model with Python and trained the data to judge the abnormal sections 

5. Visualized the result with Folium to indicate the time/location of the traffic abnormal sections
